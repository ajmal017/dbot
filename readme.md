# Trading bot - Dbot
PHP trading bot framework

## Requirements
Dbot requires PHP version 7.2 or greater, mysql server also required for data storage. 
This project includes automatic trading with basic strategies. All testing and coding was done on Mac OSX so this will work on other linux system but I will
never bother to do this for Windows. For Windows users you are on your own.

### Set up commands
```
1. https://github.com/deakzsolt/dbot.git2. cd dbot
2. sudo pecl install trader
```
